To start off the implementation of this scenario, you need to create a stream that represent sensors.
This stream will contain a timestamp field called `TIMESTAMP` to indicate when the sensor was enabled.
Each sensor will also have a field called `ENABLED` to indicate whether the status of the sensor.
While the this stream acts upon data stored in a topic called `SENSORS_RAW`, we will create another stream called `SENSORS` to actually handle the sensors.
This stream simply copies the data from the previous stream, but making sure that the `ID` field is used as key.
