This application compares merchant and mobile user geolocation data to produce user proximity alerts. Initially, merchant data is sourced from a database and contains a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash[Geohash] value per merchant. This data is streamed from a source database and loaded into a ksqlDB table, keyed by the Geohash to a defined precision (the length of the hash). User location data is streamed from mobile devices and is joined to the merchant table by the Geohash. Location events that match are published to a "raw" alerts stream, which is further refined using the ksqlDB scalar function `GEO_LOCATION`. This produces a final result of `promo_alerts`, which contains user and merchant data with geolocation information.
