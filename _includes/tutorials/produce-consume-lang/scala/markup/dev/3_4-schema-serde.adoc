The case class instances in our code will be serialized in an https://avro.apache.org/[Avro] format.
To do so, we will need the appropriate serializers/deserializers.
We add the following function to easily create a `Serializer[T]` where `T` in the type of the key or the value
we'd like to serialise.

While the specific method (where code is generated from schemas) for creating record is more common,
in scala you might want to use the reflection method (where schemas is generated from code)
to preserve your case class flexibility. Since Confluent 5.4.0, a
`https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/datatypes.html#reflection-avro[ReflectionAvroSerde]` class
let you do that, but using it in scala might result in a incomplete type management. The previous file shows
a quick way to cover this need in scala by using https://github.com/sksamuel/avro4s[Avro4s].
Avro4s is a scala library generation of Apache Avro objects. It will create records or instances in two steps:

- Serialization:    Raw bytes <- Generic Records <- Case Class Instances
- Deserialization:  Raw bytes -> Generic Records -> Case Class Instances
