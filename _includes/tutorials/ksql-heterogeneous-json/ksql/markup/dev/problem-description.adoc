Let's say you have a topic `source_data`, that gets inputs from different producers, each using JSON in a different format. They each have one field in common that you want to pull out in a query and you don't care about the structure of the individual JSON objects

[source, json]
----
{
  "JSONTypeOne": {
    "fieldA": "some data",
    "numberField": 1.001,  <1>
    "oneOnlyField": "more data",
    "randomField": "random data"
  },

  "JSONTypeTwo": {
    "fieldA": "data",
    "fieldB": "b-data",
    "numberField": 98.6.   <2>
  },

  "JSONTypeThree": {
    "fieldA": "data",
    "fieldB": "b-data",
    "numberField": 98.6,  <3>
    "fieldC": "data",
    "fieldD": "b-data"
  }
----
<1> The field you want from JSONTypeOne
<2> The field you want from JSONTypeTwo
<3> The field you want form JSONTypeThree

The key to approaching this problem is having some way to generically model each structure, without having to know details beyond the name of the field you want to extract.
