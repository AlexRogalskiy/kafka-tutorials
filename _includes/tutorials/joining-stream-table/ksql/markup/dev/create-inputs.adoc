First, you'll need to create a Kafka topic and table to represent the movie reference data. The following creates both in one shot:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/joining-stream-table/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/create-movies-table.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

In this case the lookup data originates from a Kafka topic but this doesn't always have to be the case. You can use Kafka Connect to stream data from a source system (such as a database) into a Kafka topic, which could then be the foundation for your ksqlDB lookup table.
