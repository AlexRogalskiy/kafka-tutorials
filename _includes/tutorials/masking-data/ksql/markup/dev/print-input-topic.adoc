First we tell ksqlDB to query data from the beginning of the topic:
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/masking-data/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/set-offset-reset.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

Our purchases stream is created and should be populated with data, let's double check that with the following command:
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/masking-data/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-input-topic.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield roughly the following output. The order will be different depending on how the records were actually inserted. Note that PII like name, birthdate, city, and country are present.
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/masking-data/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-print-input.log %}</code></pre>
+++++
