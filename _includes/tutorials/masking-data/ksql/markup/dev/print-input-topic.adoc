Our purchases stream is created and should be populated with data, let's double check that by using `PRINT` to see the stream's contents.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/masking-data/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-input-topic.sql %}</code></pre>

This should yield roughly the following output. The order will be different depending on how the records were actually inserted. Note that PII like name, birthdate, city, and country are present.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/masking-data/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-print-input.log %}</code></pre>

Next we will highlight two ways to mask PII data, both methods will result in new streams. In order to pull all of the preexisting events from our original purchases stream into these new streams, let's set our offset reset property to the following:
