The KSQL table (and thus Kafka topic) contains a list of accounts against which more than three suspicious transactions have taken place in a 24-hour window. The window start time is included in the Kafka message:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/anomaly-detection/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-accounts-to-monitor.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

The output should look like the following:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/anomaly-detection/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-accounts-to-monitor.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

This Kafka topic can be used to drive monitoring and alerting applications that could take action such as placing a hold on the account, notifying the card holder, etc.
