This tutorial assumes that the audit log records are already located in a Confluent Cloud cluster directly controlled by the end user.  If not, then the user will need to copy the audit logs from the original cluster to the one where they have their ksqlDB cluster running.  If you have a link:https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/cluster-types.html#dedicated-clusters[dedicated cluster] one option would be to use link:https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/multi-cloud/cluster-linking/index.html#cluster-linking-on-ccloud[cluster linking].
