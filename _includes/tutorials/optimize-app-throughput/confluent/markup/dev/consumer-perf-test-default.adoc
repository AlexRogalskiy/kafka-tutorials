Run a baseline test Kafka consumer performance test using default configuration parameters.
This test will send 5000 records of size 5000 bytes each.

Note the output results.
They should resemble something like (your results will vary):

```

```

The key thing to note here is in the last line: the throughput being `341.600055 records/sec (1.63 MB/sec)`.
