Run a baseline test Kafka producer performance test using default configuration parameters.
This test will send 10000 records of size 8000 bytes each.

Note the output results.
They should resemble something like (your results will vary):

```
...
5000 records sent, 341.600055 records/sec (1.63 MB/sec), 5663.64 ms avg latency, 13006.00 ms max latency, 5496 ms 50th, 11334 ms 95th, 12698 ms 99th, 13002 ms 99.9th.
```

The key thing to note here is in the last line: the throughput being `341.600055 records/sec (1.63 MB/sec)`.
This is the baseline producer performance with default values.
