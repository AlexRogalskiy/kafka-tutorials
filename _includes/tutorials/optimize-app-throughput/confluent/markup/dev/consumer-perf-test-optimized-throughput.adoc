Now rerun the Kafka consumer performance test using optimized configuration values.
This test will send the same number of records of the same size.

Assuming the application allows it, use consumer groups with multiple consumers to parallelize consumption.
Parallelizing consumption may improve throughput because multiple consumers can balance the load, processing multiple partitions simultaneously.
The upper limit on this parallelization is the number of partitions in the topic.

You can also do parallelization within a given consumer using link:https://www.confluent.io/blog/introducing-confluent-parallel-message-processing-client/[Confluent Parallel Consumer], which subdivides the unit of work from a partition down to a key or even a message.
For example, when partition counts are fixed for a reason beyond your control, you need to call other databases or microservices—which can take a while to respond—or use queue-like semantics, where slow-to-process messages don’t hold up faster ones further back in the queue. 

The parameters to tweak include:

* `fetch.min.bytes`: increase to ~100000 (default 1)

For a detailed explanation of why these matter, please see link:https://www.confluent.io/resources/recommendations-developers-using-confluent-cloud/[Recommendations for Developers using Confluent Cloud].

Note the output results.
They should resemble something like (your results will vary):

```
start.time, end.time, data.consumed.in.MB, MB.sec, data.consumed.in.nMsg, nMsg.sec, rebalance.time.ms, fetch.time.ms, fetch.MB.sec, fetch.nMsg.sec
2021-11-02 00:00:02:911, 2021-11-02 00:00:30:749, 570.3783, 20.4892, 100075, 3594.9062, 2990, 24848, 22.9547, 4027.4871
```

Note the last line: the throughput being `20.4892`.
Your results will vary, but what you should see is a marked improvement over the baseline.
In the case of the results shown in this tutorial, these modified configuration had more than a 3x throughput.
