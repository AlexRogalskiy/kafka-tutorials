  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

////

Now let's run a console consumer on the output topic to confirm you're application parsed the file correctly and published the expected records.
Use the same terminal window from the step where you created the required topics.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-producer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The output from the consumer can vary if you added any of your own records, but it should look something like this:

++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-producer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output.txt %}</code></pre>
++++


Now close the consumer with a `CTRL+C` then the broker shell with a `CTRL+D`
