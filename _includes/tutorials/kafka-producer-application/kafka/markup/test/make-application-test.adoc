Earlier in this tutorial, I mentioned that using a thin wrapper class around the `KafkaProducer` makes testing easier.  The key enabler for testing is that the `KafkaProducerApplication` accepts an instnace of the https://kafka.apache.org/25/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/Producer.html[Producer] **_interface_**.  The use of the interface leaves us free to inject any concrete type we want, including a https://kafka.apache.org/25/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/MockProducer.html[Mock Producer] for testing.

We use a `MockProducer` because you only want to test your own code.  So you really only need to test that the producer recieves the expected records and in the expected format.  Plus since there is no broker, the tests run very fast, which becomes an important factor as the number of tests increase.




There is only one method in `KafkaProducerApplicationTest` annotated with `@Test`, and that is `testProduce()`.  Before you create the test, let's go over a few of the key points of the test

[source, java]
----
final List<String> records = Arrays.asList("foo#bar", "bar#foo", "baz#bar", "great-weather");

records.forEach(producerApp::produce); <1>

final List<KeyValue<String, String>> expectedList = Arrays.asList(KeyValue.pair("foo", "bar"),
            KeyValue.pair("bar", "foo"),
            KeyValue.pair("baz", "bar"),
            KeyValue.pair("NO-KEY","great-weather")); <2>
final List<KeyValue<String, String>> actualList = mockProducer.history().stream().map(this::toKeyValue).collect(Collectors.toList()); <3>

----

<1> Calling the `produce` method
<2> Building the expected list of records the producer should recieve
<3> Using the `MockProducer.history()` method to validate the records sent to the producer

Now create the following file at `src/test/java/io/confluent/developer/KafkaProducerApplicationTest.java`.
