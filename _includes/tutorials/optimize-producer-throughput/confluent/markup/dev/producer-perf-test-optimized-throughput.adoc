Now rerun the Kafka producer performance test using optimized configuration values.
This test will send the same number of records of the same size.

Your results will vary depending on your connectivity and bandwidth to the Kafka cluster.

```
10000 records sent, 740.960285 records/sec (5.65 MB/sec), 3801.36 ms avg latency, 8198.00 ms max latency, 3297 ms 50th, 7525 ms 95th, 7949 ms 99th, 8130 ms 99.9th.
```

The key thing to note here is in the last line: the throughput being `740.960285 records/sec (5.65 MB/sec)`.
In your environment the performance improvement will vary, but for the test shown here, 5.65 MB/sec is about a 5x improvement over the 1.03 MB/sec baseline.
