Start by creating a ksqlDB stream for each of our two input topics coming from Connect. Then create another stream to join those two streams on `Fish_Id`. Finally, create a ksqlDB table with a windowed aggregation of our joined stream, where the average error rate is over 15%. This table will be used to trigger our model retraining process.
