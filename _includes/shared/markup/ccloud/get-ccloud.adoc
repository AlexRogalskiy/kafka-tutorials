This tutorial has some steps for Kafka topic management and/or reading from or writing to Kafka topics, for which you can use the Confluent Cloud Console or install the Confluent CLI.
Instructions for installing Confluent CLI and configuring it to your Confluent Cloud environment is available from within the Confluent Cloud Console: navigate to your Kafka cluster, click on the `CLI and tools` link, and run through the steps in the `Confluent CLI` tab.

NOTE: The CLI clients Confluent Cloud (`ccloud`) and Confluent Platform (`confluent`) have been unifed into a single client Confluent CLI (confluent v2.0).  The `ccloud` client will continue to work until May 9, 2022, but will be sunset after that point.  You can read the migration instructions and details for moving to `confluent` at https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/migrate.html .
