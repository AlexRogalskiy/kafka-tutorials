Instead of running a local Kafka cluster, you may use https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/[Confluent Cloud], a fully-managed Apache Kafka service.

Next, from the Confluent Cloud UI, click on `Clients` to get the cluster-specific configurations, e.g. Kafka cluster bootstrap servers and credentials, Confluent Cloud Schema Registry and credentials, etc., and set the appropriate parameters in your client application.
In the case of this tutorial, add the following properties to the client application's input properties file, substituting all curly braces with your Confluent Cloud values.
