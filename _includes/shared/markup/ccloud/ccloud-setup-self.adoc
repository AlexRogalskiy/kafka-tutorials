This tutorial requires access to an Apache Kafka cluster, and the quickest way to get started free is on https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/[Confluent Cloud], which provides Kafka as a fully managed service.
First, sign up for https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/[Confluent Cloud].

1. After you log in to https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/[Confluent Cloud], click on `Add cloud environment` and name the environment `learn-kafka`. Using a new environment keeps your learning resources separate from your other Confluent Cloud resources.

2. From the `Billing & payment` section in the Menu, apply the promo code `CC100KTS` to receive an additional $100 free usage on Confluent Cloud (https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud-promo-disclaimer[details]).

3. Click on https://confluent.cloud/learn[LEARN] and follow the instructions to launch a Kafka cluster and to enable Schema Registry.
