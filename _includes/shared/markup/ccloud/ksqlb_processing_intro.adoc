[NOTE]
Confluent Cloud Console does not allow you to execute this code in the ksqlDB editor as a single block.  This limitation will be removed in the next release, but until then, copy and paste each statement into the editor and execute them one at a time.
Also, when creating the intial stream or table from a Kafka topic, if the backing topic does already exist then the `PARTITIONS` property may be omitted.
